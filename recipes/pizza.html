    <p>Pepperoni pizza is one of the most popular and iconic styles of pizza, known for its bold flavors and satisfying combination of textures. It starts with a chewy, golden-brown crust that’s topped with tangy tomato sauce and a generous layer of gooey, melted mozzarella cheese. Slices of spicy, slightly smoky pepperoni are spread across the top, crisping up at the edges as they bake and releasing savory oils that mingle with the cheese.</p>
    <p>The result is a pizza that’s rich, flavorful, and perfectly balanced—cheesy, saucy, and just the right amount of spicy. Often enjoyed fresh from the oven with a bubbly, blistered crust, pepperoni pizza is a timeless favorite that’s perfect for sharing with family and friends.</p>

    <h3>Cooking steps</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 475°F (245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the dough</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Lightly flour your work surface and roll or stretch the pizza dough into a 12–14 inch circle (or rectangle if using a sheet pan).</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a parchment-lined baking sheet or a pizza peel if using a stone.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add the sauce</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Spread about 1/2 cup of pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving about 1 inch around the edges for the crust.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Layer the cheese</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sprinkle shredded mozzarella evenly over the sauce.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Add pepperoni</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Arrange 20–30 slices of pepperoni on top of the cheese. You can overlap slightly if you like extra coverage.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season (optional)</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Sprinkle with dried oregano or red pepper flakes for added flavor.</li>
                <li>Brush the outer crust lightly with olive oil for a golden finish.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bake the pizza</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Bake for 12–15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned in spots.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Slice & serve</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Let pizza cool 2–3 minutes, then slice and enjoy hot!</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
