    <p>A cheeseburger is a classic American comfort food made with a juicy, seasoned beef patty layered inside a soft, toasted bun and topped with a slice of melted cheese. The cheese—often cheddar, American, or Swiss—adds a rich, creamy flavor that balances the savory meat. Many cheeseburgers are finished with fresh toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles, along with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise.</p>
    <p>Depending on style, a cheeseburger can be kept simple and traditional, or stacked high with bacon, avocado, grilled mushrooms, or specialty sauces. Served with crispy fries or onion rings, it’s a timeless meal that represents hearty satisfaction in every bite.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>4 leaves crisp lettuce</li>
        <li>4 slices tomato</li>
        <li>4 slices onion (red or white)</li>
        <li>8 dill pickle slices</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonaise (optional)</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking the Burger</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep toppings & buns</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Slice tomato, onion, and pickles. Separate lettuce leaves. Split buns and lightly butter the cut sides.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Form the patties</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Divide 1 lb ground beef into 4 equal balls (about 4 oz each). Gently press into 3/4-inch thick patties a little wider than the buns. Make a shallow thumb dent in the center of each to prevent doming.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Preheat & toast</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Heat a grill to medium-high (about 450°F) or a skillet over medium-high. Toast buns cut-side down until golden; set aside.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Season</strong>
            <ul style="line-height: none;"s>
                <li>Just before cooking, season both sides of each patty generously with salt and black pepper.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Cook the patties</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Grill/skillet: Cook 3–4 minutes on the first side until nicely browned.</li>
                <li>Flip and cook 2–4 minutes more, depending on doneness. (USDA safe temp for ground beef is 160°F; medium is around 145°F. Use a thermometer if you want precision.)</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Melt the cheese</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Place a slice of cheese on each patty during the last minute. Cover grill/skillet to help it melt (a lid or inverted metal bowl works).</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Assemble</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Spread ketchup, mustard, and/or mayo on the toasted buns. Layer lettuce on the bottom bun (helps keep it from getting soggy), add the cheesy patty, then tomato, onion, and pickles. Cap with the top bun.</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
        <li><strong>Serve</strong>
            <ul style="list-style: none;">
                <li>Let burgers rest 1–2 minutes so juices settle, then serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
            </ul>
        
        </li>
