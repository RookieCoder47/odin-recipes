    <p>A cheeseburger is a classic American comfort food made with a juicy, seasoned beef patty layered inside a soft, toasted bun and topped with a slice of melted cheese. The cheese—often cheddar, American, or Swiss—adds a rich, creamy flavor that balances the savory meat. Many cheeseburgers are finished with fresh toppings like lettuce, tomato, onions, and pickles, along with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, or mayonnaise.</p>
    <p>Depending on style, a cheeseburger can be kept simple and traditional, or stacked high with bacon, avocado, grilled mushrooms, or specialty sauces. Served with crispy fries or onion rings, it’s a timeless meal that represents hearty satisfaction in every bite.</p>
